# CS-212

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project one implements a dual clock program that displays a 12 hour and 24 hour clock simultaneously that allows user input to add hours, minutes, or seconds.

What did you do particularly well?
Following idustry standard best practices by using appropriate naming conventions for functions and seperating files, using in-line comments to enhance readability and maintainability for clean and readable code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could include a general function that adjusts hours, minutes, or seconds depending on user input. This would combine all three functions to improve readability and efficiency.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code was writing a function for when the time reaches 60 minutes or 24 hours. I broke it down into three reusable functions. I used resources such as zybooks and the C++ standard library to look at when writing code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Using separate files to minimize main, input handling and calculating time and overflow.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By keeping naming conventions and in-line comments consistent, using a struct(Time) for grouping related data. I also wrote small, single purpose functions that makes it easy to modify or extend.
